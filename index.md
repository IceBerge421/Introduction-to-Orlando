# What is UCF like? 

English Department faculty work on UCF’s main campus, which houses the vast majority of our academic programs and hosts most of our ~70,000 students (~60,000 undergraduates and ~10,000 graduate and medical students). UCF’s home page is [here](https://www.ucf.edu/); more information on student demographics, overall structure, and budget are [here](https://www.ucf.edu/about-ucf/facts/).

The [English Department](https://english.cah.ucf.edu/) is the largest unit in the [College of Arts and Humanities](https://cah.ucf.edu/). Many of the other CAH programs are hosted in Trevor Colbourn Hall on the west side of campus (an interactive campus map is [here](https://map.ucf.edu/)). Some of the other units housed in our building are:

* [UCF's Texts and Technology](https://tandt.cah.ucf.edu/) PhD Program 
* [Center for Humanities and Digital Research](https://chdr.cah.ucf.edu/)
* [University Writing Center](https://uwc.cah.ucf.edu/)  
* [UCF's Graduate Student Center](https://graduate.ucf.edu/graduate-student-center/) 
* As well as the departments of History, Writing and Rhetoric, Modern Languages and Literatures and our area studies programs (including Women’s and Gender Studies and Themed Experience, as well as several interdisciplinary minor programs) 

We have created a short tour of the English Department and Trevor Colbourn Hall that covers some of the things that campus visitors would usually see in the course of their visit (click the “CC” in bottom right to enable captions): [https://vimeo.com/673233104](https://vimeo.com/673233104)

# What’s around UCF? 
UCF is located in northeast Orange County, next to the border with Seminole County. It’s a 30-45 minute drive to downtown Orlando, depending on traffic. 

### Local towns and communities 

* Oviedo & north Alafaya- Over the Seminole County border, Oviedo has a small town atmosphere. Between UCF and Oviedo along Alafaya Trail are extensive exurban housing developments built in the last 5-15 years. There is also housing available in unincorporated Seminole County (e.g., Aloma Woods) near the Orange County border that still receives an Oviedo zip code and mailing address.
* Bithlo & east Orange County- East and south of UCF is an area with a mix of rural development and sprawling gated exurbs. 
* Avalon Park - Urban planning area south of UCF featuring a downtown area with restaurants, shops, a YMCA, a Publix shopping center, and multiple parks, pools, playgrounds, and daycares. Frequent free public events and festivals in the central park area. Mix of single family homes, townhomes, and apartments.  [https://www.avalonparkorlando.com/](https://www.avalonparkorlando.com/) 
* South Alafaya & Waterford Lakes- South of UCF along Alafaya Trail, this area has a combination of dense apartments and condos and sprawling exurbs. Waterford Lakes is a large shopping complex several miles south of UCF.
* Audubon Park- Somewhat of an artsy vibe, in recent years this suburban area with mainly single-family homes has become more popular with younger families. 
* Downtown Orlando- Housing here ranges from single-family homes to highrises. Downtown and the areas surrounding it–including SODO, Colonialtown North, Hourglass District, Delaney Park, Mills 50, Milk District–are surprisingly green, walkable, and pet-friendly. Easy 20-30 minute drive to main campus, and adjacent to downtown campus.
* Wadeview Park—in what’s called the SODO (South of Downtown Orlando) area, this is an older established neighborhood with lots of mid-century bungalows and some newer townhouses and single-family homes. It’s convenient to Downtown with quick access to I-4 and the 408 for commuting.College Park–Technically, part of the city of Orlando, but with its own independent strip of shops (many locally owned) and restaurants, many lakes and small parks, live oaks with flowing Spanish moss, and its own almost small-town vibe. It can be expensive to buy, but sometimes there are good deals on rentals, small bungalows especially. 
* Winter Park–a small city just north of Orlando, about 30 minutes from campus, 15 minutes from downtown Orlando. Lots of arts and cultural institutions, including Rollins College (great art museum), Leu Gardens, Mead Garden, Lake Baldwin Dog Park (23+ acres of fields, trees, and lake allowing off-leash dog fun), Morse Museum, galleries and shops on Park Ave. More walkable and bikeable than much of suburban Orlando. Can be expensive. 
* Winter Springs and Casselberry–these areas are suburban and some older (1940s-50s) housing. Casselberry is a “sleepy” quiet town/area except the section of it on 436 (a nightmare of a road IYAM). Winter Springs has a range of housing prices, mostly sprawling suburbs with outdoor space. About a 20 minute drive to UCF and to anyplace downtown Orlando.
* Sanford–County seat of Seminole. Nice old Florida feel to downtown. Riverwalk path along the huge Lake. Housing tends to be less expensive. Easy access to 417 (limited access highway) to UCF.

# Where might I live? 

Orange County’s public transportation system is not well developed compared to other comparable regions–Central Florida is very car-centric. The Lynx bus system serves as primary public transportation. UCF faculty, staff, and students can ride Lynx free with a UCF ID. The county has bicycling infrastructure and the trail network is expanding. However, the system is geared more towards recreational riding and there are gaps in the trail system, unfortunately including connectivity to UCF. Most major roads do have bike lanes marked, so for cyclists who have experience riding in traffic, bike commuting is an option. The SunRail commuter train system provides a good way to get between places like Winter Park, Longwood, and Kissimmee, but it does not connect to UCF.

## Overview: Housing Costs 

Like other large metro areas, housing costs are unfortunately high in Orlando. Average monthly rent ranges from $1,300-$1,700 depending on location and apartment type. Rents have been increasing slightly more than the national average over the past year because of a combination of few affordable housing options, population growth, real estate speculation, and a high percentage of apartments used for vacation rentals. 

## Renting 

### Air Conditioning 

**Whether you rent or buy, it is CRUCIAL that you check the air conditioner for your specific unit prior to signing a contract**. You need to check to see what the cubic feet or meters it is rated for and compare it to the size of the domicile. Otherwise, you will pay hundreds of dollars per month for an AC that cannot sufficiently cool your home. **In typical rental contracts, the management company is not responsible for fully repairing or replacing your AC unit unless your home reaches a sustained internal temperature of 80 degrees fahrenheit**. Since AC units are expensive, management companies are eager to implement “quick fixes” such as adding more coolant rather than purchasing a new AC unit (which cost thousands of dollars). A working AC unit will also keep your home appropriately humid (i.e., not too humid). If your AC unit is not working well, you should consider purchasing a portable dehumidifier that can be emptied multiple times per day or hooked up to your water system and automatically emptied. 

### Questions to Ask Before Renting 

Moving is difficult! Asking these questions prior to renting a unit will make your life easier and help you decide between places.

1. Who manages this unit? How do I get in touch with them? Are they responsible for repairs or are repairs outsourced to a third-party team or company? 
2. How old is the air conditioning unit? What size space is it rated for? Has it ever had any problems? What is the air conditioning repair policy? (Note: Walk around the building and look at the air conditioning unit if at all possible! If it looks rusted or old or otherwise imperfect, proceed with extreme caution.) 
3. What is the pet fee–initial fee, monthly fee, etc.? Are there additional mandatory pet charges billed during move out?
4. What is the renter’s insurance requirement? 
5. Is there an emergency maintenance team? 
6. What are all of the additional fees that I will need to pay–both to secure the place and monthly? For example, are there administrative fees/security deposits, monthly fees for pets or garbage or recycling, etc.? Is there a fee for paying in certain ways (i.e., by credit card) rather than others? Does it cost money to turn on the water, for instance? 
7. What is the rental application fee?
8. Is there a pest fee? What does it cover? How often is the pest service available? How do I request that they service my unit? (Many places do this for free.)
9. What is the policy for recycling–both plastics and cardboard? 
10. Is there assigned parking? Is there a parking fee? How many cars can I park? Do I need to register/validate visitors’ parking prior to their arrival, at the time of their arrival, etc.?

For more ideas, see this [list](https://www.apartments.com/rental-manager/resources/article/20-revealing-questions-that-every-renter-should-ask).

Note: It is worthwhile to do some research on your rights and privileges as a Florida renter. Each state has different laws, and you should know what you are responsible for vs. the management company. See the following sources for details:

* [Landlord/Tenant Laws in Florida](https://www.fdacs.gov/Consumer-Resources/Landlord-Tenant-Law-in-Florida)
* [Rights and Duties of Tenants and Landlords](https://www.floridabar.org/public/consumer/tip014/)
* [2021 Florida Statutes](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0083/0083.html) related to tenants and renting
* [Tenant’s Handbook](https://bals.org/help/resources/tenants-handbook)

### Recommended Apartment Complexes  

Faculty members have lived at the following apartment complexes over the last five years:

* [Watermark Lake Nona](https://www.lakenonawatermark.com/) (an easy drive to campus up 417, the toll road, but farther removed from many of the dining and entertainment options in downtown Orlando)
* [Enders Place at Baldwin Park](https://www.endersplaceatbaldwinparkorlando.com/) (on the expensive side–only rent a unit if the AC is 5 years or younger)
* [Trailside Gardens at Alafaya Apartments](https://www.trailsidegardensapts.com/?utm_source=GMB&utm_medium=organic) (well-maintained but moderately expensive apartments within walking/biking distance of UCF, and with an Oviedo zip code for schools; you can also get the shuttle to campus by walking across the street to Riverwind Apartments)
* [Avisa Lakes](https://www.avisalakes.com/) (Quiet, somewhat secluded apartment complex about 15 minutes from UCF. Easy access to 408 for a quick drive to Waterford Lakes or downtown Orlando. On the pricier side, but with multiple amenities and well maintained outdoors areas. Gated complex)
* [Rental Property Management](https://rpmrealty.net/): If you’re looking to rent a house, we had a great experience our first two years here with Rental Property Management. They have houses all over Orlando, and some are competitively priced. But they were _very _responsive to maintenance requests, and even put my family up in a hotel early on in the pandemic while they had to replace an interior wall due to water damage.  

## Buying 

According to Realtor.com, the median Orlando home price is $335,000. In broader Orange County, the median price is $370,000, and in Seminole county it is $363,000. The cost of homes has been rising a bit higher than the national average, due to many of the same factors as the cost of rent. However, for around $230,000, it is possible to purchase a two bedroom home in areas around a 20-25 minute drive from UCF-use the Map search function in Zillow for more details. 

When planning a potential homeowner’s budget, **keep in mind that Florida has extremely expensive homeowner’s insurance**, and that it is going up massively (10-30% in many cases) every year. This is a result of hurricanes and insurance fraud. **Old home insurance quotes that you might find online may not reflect current realities.**

FYI: **Many insurers will no longer insure roofs over 15 years old.** This just changed (from 20 years). This means that you may need to have a roof replaced soon after or during the purchasing process.

# What else should I know about living in Central Florida? 

### Budgeting 

Florida car insurance is more expensive than in many other places. For example, my spouse and I own two older cars (5+ years old) and have no history of accidents, but we pay close to $200 per month for car insurance. Consider buying a 6-month plan and looking around for better prices before you renew. Most of the nationally known providers are available (Geico, Nationwide, etc.) but prices seem to vary and it can be worth shopping around a bit. Addendum: Nationwide refused to cover us (the Hopkins family)  in FL after having been customers with them for 8 years in OH/IN. We had to switch to State Farm, which was pricey at first, but got a lot better after we bundled our homeowner’s insurance with them. 

### Climate and Wildlife

Florida summers are more like winter in cold places. By this, I mean that people primarily hunker down and stay inside in the summer, when it is quite warm, and people become more active in the winter when the weather is more temperate. If you have not lived in a warm climate before, this shift may take a bit of adjustment. 

Winter is our cool, dry season, and summer is our hot monsoon season, with near-daily afternoon thunderstorms. Hurricane season runs from June through November; more info on tropical cyclone preparation [here](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/).

We share Central Florida with a variety of wildlife, including black racers (snakes), geckos/iguanas, and more. Cats love watching them out the windows! They are generally not dangerous, but keep an eye out to ensure that small children don’t get too friendly with them. We do have some wildlife that are more potentially dangerous, including black bears, alligators, venomous snakes, and fire ants. Just keep your distance and give them space and you should be fine (except for fire ants, who are just jerks).

### Travel 

The Orlando airport (MCO) has a ton of flights, many of which are direct, all over the United States. The airport has a tram that you must take to get between terminals. However, don’t forget to check the Sanford airport (SFB) for flights as well. Parking is very easy there and it’s a much smaller airport, which may be preferable for people with young children. They also sometimes have inexpensive flights on airlines such as Allegiant. 

### Logistics and Transportation 

You’ll need a [SunPass](https://www.sunpass.com/en/home/index.shtml), [E-Pass](https://epass.cfxway.com/epassweb), or [EZ Pass](https://www.e-zpassiag.com/) for all of your cars, since it’s almost impossible to avoid the toll roads. These passes are most easily purchased online and multiple cars can be put on one account. If you are flying in and renting a car, the rental companies add an extra charge for using their SunPass plus the tolls. I recommend buying one in advance and bringing it with you. Otherwise, be sure to bring change for paying tolls. 

Prepare for family and friends to visit often! Many companies have annual meetings or conferences at the many conference centers and resorts in Orlando, and people from across the U.S. visit Disney World and the other area theme parks. There are many dining options near the airport (MCO) if you’re looking to catch a quick bite with someone on their way to or from the airport. If you’d like to meet up with someone who is doing the theme parks, Disney Springs, CityWalk (Universal), and i-Drive areas are good places to meet up.

Buy sunglasses! You’ll use them all the time. Recommended places for inexpensive prescription sunglasses: [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/) (locations in Winter Park and Millenia Mall) and [Liingo](https://liingoeyewear.com/) (online-only).

Public transport is not particularly strong or reliable here, so a car is probably a necessity. Registering your car in Florida requires the DMV people to go out to your car to check the VIN number, so you can’t register a car unless you drive it to the office. Annual car tax (auto registration) renews on your birthday rather than in January.

Most people in Orlando proper are required to use OUC (Orlando Utilities Commission) for electricity. They are terrible at processing mail-in payments, so I recommend paying by echeck or sending in your mailed payment at least 3 weeks in advance to avoid a late fee.

Hotels in the Orlando area are very spread out. For example, if you live in the Audubon Park area, the closest hotels are next to UCF, downtown, or in south Orlando. If visitors are looking for a wider variety of accommodations, they might consider looking for something closer to Altamonte Springs, UCF, or Lake Nona (if they have a SunPass). 

### Shopping 

Orlando has both regular Costcos (in Winter Park and South Orlando) and [Costco Business Center](https://www.costcobusinessdelivery.com/), located in south Orlando, which has a huge range of offerings. To access Costco Business Center, you only need a regular Costco membership. Even though you likely do not own a small business, the Costco Business Center has some of the best prices on kitchen products that I’ve seen and is much less crowded than regular costco.

Central Florida has many grocery store options, including Publix (probably the most popular), Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Sprouts, Costco, Sam’s Club, Super Target, Walmart Grocery, Bravo, Aldi, etc. Grocery stores sell only wine and beer, but some such as Publix, Sam’s Club, etc. have their own liquor stores next door (i.e., the Baldwin Park Publix has a Publix Liquors next door). 

[Clemons Produce](https://www.facebook.com/ClemonsProduceOrlando/), [Freshfields Farm](https://www.freshfieldsfarm.com/), and other produce markets offer high-quality fruit and vegetables for very low prices. Look for unique Florida finds such as long neck avocados (typically available for a few weeks in August)! There are also CSAs (such as [Big Daddy’s Organic Farm](https://www.bigdaddysorganics.com/)) and local produce delivery boxes (such as [Get Florida Produce](https://www.getfloridaproduce.com/)) that have seasonal offerings. CSAs typically run from November-March.

The [Vineland Outlets](https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/orlando-vineland) in south Orlando have very long hours (i.e., they are open until 11:00pm or so) and are very crowded on the weekends. If you want to walk around there, I recommend doing so on a regular weeknight. Otherwise, parking can be a nightmare. 

Chewy.com has a facility in Ocala, FL (not far from Orlando), which means that you can typically have products delivered within 24-48 hours without paying an additional charge for faster shipping.

### Discounts and Perks 

Florida residents are able to purchase an annual pass to the Orlando-area theme parks for a reduced price. Note that these passes are a good deal if you enjoy going to the theme parks 2 or more times per year, but they have blackout dates and some other constraints to consider. 

[Many additional benefits also listed here](https://hr.ucf.edu/current-employees/benefits/additional-employee-benefits/)

[Certain companies offer discounts (like Verizon) to UCF faculty and can be found here](https://hr.ucf.edu/current-employees/benefits/additional-employee-benefits/employee-discount-program/)

You can get big discounts to many local attractions (incl. Disney, SeaWorld, etc) at the [SGA ticket office](https://ticketcenter.sdes.ucf.edu/) on campus. Some tickets/passes have restrictive conditions/

# Additional Advice: Working at UCF 

### Parking 

Parking at UCF can be difficult. There are generally plenty of spots available early in the morning, so if you have an afternoon class it can be better to arrive earlier in the day and work from your office or the library or try to find a parking spot during the lunchtime exodus. The beginnings of the fall and spring semesters are the trickiest times to find parking. You can pay for an annual parking pass (~$350), but the F garage is free to park in (except game days), and is only about a 15-20 minute walk to Trevor Colbourn Hall.

### Insurance 

UCF insurance is pre-paid out of your salary so that you have insurance over the summer. This means that you’ll have double deductions for a few months during the academic year (September-April) and no payments over the summer.

### Faculty Union: UFF-UCF  

UCF faculty are organized into a chapter of [United Faculty of Florida](https://www.uffucf.org/). UCF is a collectively bargained university and you can find the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), agreed to by the United Faculty of Florida and the UCF Board of Trustees, at this location: [https://www.collectivebargaining.ucf.edu/completecba.asp](https://www.collectivebargaining.ucf.edu/completecba.asp). The faculty’s right to collectively bargain is enshrined in the FL state constitution, though FL is also a right-to-work state.

### Teaching

The [UCF Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning (FCTL)](https://fctl.ucf.edu/) is full of friendly people who are excited to talk with you about teaching. Participating in their winter or summer workshops is a great way to meet faculty from other departments. (And your participation usually comes with a small stipend!) They have a virtual and in-person writing group that meets on Friday mornings, and they can help connect you to the many resources for teaching on campus, such as the [Multimedia Center](https://cdl.ucf.edu/support/fmc/booking/#FMCAppointment) (which has equipment for recording audio and video for your courses and a bunch of other stuff).

### Recordkeeping

Keeping good records can pay dividends. For example, UCF has an extensive number of (competitive) teaching and research-related awards available, including Excellence in Research/Teaching Awards (generally a $1-2k one time stipend) as well as more lucrative awards including the Teaching Incentive Program (TIP) award, the Research Incentive Award (RIA), and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) awards. You become eligible to apply for the latter three awards after five years of service and selected applicants receive $5k base salary increases. With this in mind, and also for the purposes of promotion and annual evaluation, it is a good idea to develop a plan to collect and organize important documents related to your UCF activities (e.g., letters of thanks from students, evidence of student learning, thank you letters about service, etc.) 

UCF is a big university and there will be lots to get used to in the first year or so, so it is important to have a sustainable strategy for organizing materials and to have an idea of the types of awards available prior to beginning your work here. For more information about UCF’s awards see [https://facultyexcellence.ucf.edu/awards/](https://facultyexcellence.ucf.edu/awards/). 

### Semester Schedule 

Take note of UCF’s typical semester schedule. Fall semester classes generally begin in mid-August and go until the first week of December. Final exams conclude in mid-December. UCF does not have a fall break. Spring semester classes generally begin in early January (the first or second week) and go until the last week of April. Final exams conclude in early May.
